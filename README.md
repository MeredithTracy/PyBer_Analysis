# PyBer_Analysis

## Resources
-	Data source: [city_data.csv](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv) and [ride_data.csv](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv).
-	Software: Python 3.8.8, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0

## Overview
PyBer hired us to perform an analysis on their ride sharing data from 2019 in order to gain insight on their metrics by city type to see how drivers and fares differ to better understand how they can improve their service for their customers. We will run an exploratory analysis then create visualizations to better express our findings. 

## Results
After completing my analysis of the data provided by PyBer, I have been able to recognize some trends in city types in relation to fare and driver counts.

This chart shows the counts and averages for the ride share data provided by PyBer grouped by  city type.


![Pyber_fare_summary](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png)
This graph shows the total fare per week from Jan 2019 â€“ April 2019 grouped by city type.


-	Urban cities overall have the highest driver count, weekly fare amounts, and total fare amount. 
-	Urban cities also have the lowest averages for fares per ride and fares per driver. This is likely due to the fact that rides in urban cities are usually shorter in length and duration. 
-	While rural cities have the lowest number of rides, drivers, weekly fares, and total fares, they also have the highest average for fares per ride and fares per driver. This is likely due to destinations in rural areas being farther away and therefore have a longer duration. 
-	Suburban cities run the middle of group for all categories: total rides, driver count, total fares, and the averages for fares per driver and ride. They do have more than 6x the drivers and 5x more rides compared to rural cities. 

Overall, this data shows that PyBer is accessed more and creates more overall revenue in urban cities. Even if the fares per ride are shorter, their overall profits are higher compared to suburban and rural cities. 

## Summary 
This brings us to what recommendations I would make to PyBer to improve their services and increase their revenue. 
-	Focus on increasing their driver count in rural areas may bring in more rides. Because their rides are likely longer in duration, people may not be able to access drivers because they are all occupied with other rides. 
-	In addition, focus on marketing the company in rural areas to get their overall ride counts up to bring in more revenue. This may be more interpersonal marketing as smaller towns may not be aware that PyBer is an available resource to them. 
-	Marketing availability for Urban city drivers to be able to take longer trips to destinations farther out may assist in increasing their averages for both drivers and rides.
